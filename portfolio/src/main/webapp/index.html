          こんにちは, Привет, and hello! My name’s Kira. I’m an 18 year old rising sophomore at 
          Loyola Marymount University in Southern California, and I’m currently 
          majoring in computer science with minors in electrical engineering and Japanese. 
          Thanks for taking a look at my profile, and feel free to click around to learn 
          more about me!
      </p>

              <li data-message="Video games have been an important part of my 
              life since I was very young, so I started teaching myself how to code 
              when I was 14 so that I could create my own games. I began working in 
              GameMaker (GML), then transitioned to Unity (C# and Javascript), and 
              eventually started taking formal classes through Northwestern and USC
              when I realised how much I enjoyed it!">

              (often, these three culminate in the form of small video games.) I also really enjoy 
              music and can play the piano and the kalimba (which is a wooden African thumb piano). 
              Additionally, I like to be active, and love to playing water polo, softball, or simply
              going for a hike with my dogs.">

              Hereditary, It Follows, The Exorcist, The Shining, and Midsommar), horror video games, 
              horror manga and books … pretty much anything related to my favorite genre! I also enjoy 
              learning languages, and am currently studying Japanese in university and learning some 
              Russian and ASL from my mother in my spare time.">
