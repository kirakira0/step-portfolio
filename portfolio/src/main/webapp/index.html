          こんにちは, Привет, and hello! My name’s Kira. I’m a rising sophomore at 
          Loyola Marymount University in Southern California, and I’m currently 
          majoring in computer science with minors in electrical engineering and Japanese. 
          Thanks for taking a look at my profile, and feel free to click around to learn 
          more about me!

              <li data-message="Video games have been an important part of my 
              life since I was very young, so I started teaching myself how to code 
              when I was 14 so that I could create my own games. I began working in 
              GameMaker (GML), then transitioned to Unity (C# and Javascript), and 
              eventually started taking formal, online classes throughout high school 
              when I realised how much I enjoyed it!">

              <li data-message="Over the course of this STEP internship, my goal is 
              to learn how to be a great collaborator. To me, this includes both mastering 
              technical skills including utilising Github and handling pesky merge conflicts, 
              as well as soft skills such as effectively communicating my ideas. I’m so excited 
              to work with such an awesome pod and ready to work hard to make meaningful 
              contributions to the team and the company.">
                  Goals
              </li>
              <li data-message="In my spare time, I enjoy writing, drawing, and programming 
              (often, these three culminate in the form of small video games.) I also really enjoy 
              music, and though I’m nowhere near skilled at either, I love to play the piano and 
              the kalimba (which is a wooden African thumb piano). Additionally, I like to be active, 
              and go for hikes in the mountains by my house or swims at the beach whenever I get the 
              chance.">
                Hobbies
              </li>
              <li data-message="I absolutely adore horror movies (some of my favorites include 
              Hereditary, It Follows, The Exorcist, The Shining, and Midsommar), horror video games, 
              horror manga and books … pretty much anything related to my favorite genre! I also enjoy 
              learning languages, and am currently studying Japanese in university and learning some 
              Russian and ASL from my mother in my spare time.">
